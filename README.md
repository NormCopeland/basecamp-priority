# Basecamp Priority Everywhere

Add priority functionality to your Basecamp tasks from any view. This extension brings the "Prioritize" action to every task view in Basecamp, not just the "My Assignments" page.

## Features

- Prioritize tasks directly from:
  - Project todo lists
  - Individual task views
  - Search results
  - Recent activity
  - Drag handle menu
  - Any view showing tasks

- Seamlessly integrates with Basecamp's native interface
- Maintains Basecamp's original styling and behavior
- No configuration needed - works instantly
- Zero impact on performance

## How It Works

The "Prioritize" option appears in two places:
1. In the task menu (three dots) for any task you have permission to prioritize
2. In the drag handle menu when viewing tasks in a list

Simply click the "Prioritize" option to instantly add the task to your priority list.

## Privacy & Security

- No data collection
